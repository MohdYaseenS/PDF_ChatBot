# PDF_ChatBot
This project builds an interactive PDF Chatbot that allows users to upload PDF documents and ask natural language questions about their content. The system uses open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) (like Llama 2, Mistral, or Falcon) accessed via an LLM API, combined with a PDF reader to extract and process text from documents.
